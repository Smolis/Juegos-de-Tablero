Each player begins with two pieces.

During their turn, players move one of their pieces either one or two spaces in any direction if possible.

Diagonal distances are equivalent to orthogonal distances, e.g. it is legal to move to a square whose relative position is two squares away both vertically 
and horizontally. If the destination is adjacent to the source, a new piece is created on the empty departure square. 
Otherwise the piece on the source moves to the destination.
After the move, all of the opponent player's pieces adjacent to the destination square are converted to the color of the moving player. 
Players must move unless no legal move is possible, in which case they must pass.

The board configuration may be altered by having certain squares filled (not playable by either player), or using different board sizes.

The game ends when all squares have been filled or all the players except one have no remaining pieces. 
The player with the most pieces wins. 
A draw may occur when the number of squares are even, either from non playable squares or non standard sizes having an even number of squares.
Some versions also implement the threefold repetition rule from chess.
